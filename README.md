# CarRental
This project is being developed for the Akdeniz University Web Programming course.
The website will be a simple car rental system. 
Users will be able to rent a car between certain time intervals, make payments, create a user account and use simple user features such as changing passwords.
There will be also an admin interface.
Admin will be able to see rented and suitable cars. He/She will be able to add a new car to the system and delete it from the system whenever he wants.
